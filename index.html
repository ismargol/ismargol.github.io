Hello! I'm Ian Margol. I'm using this site to practice my HTML skills. I haven't really used these since Myspace! I was even better at them back when AOL Homepages were a thing. I have been working as a TV news journalist since since 2013. I started my very first job in Grand Junction, CO, then worked my way up to Savannah, GA, before eventually landing in Miami, FL. <br> I love journalism, but the everyday grind of news is absolutely exhausting, so I'm working toward combining my love of news with my passion for teaching, and becoming a college journalism professor. I'm really looking forward to learning a lot in this class and implimenting some of it into my daily work and my eventual teaching!</p>
